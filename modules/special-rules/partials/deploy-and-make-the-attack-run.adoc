Deploy, and make the attack run::
. When play passes to you in the Movement phase, place all of the Ready units in the detachment at any point along any edge of the playing area.
You must place them so that they all face in the same direction.
This is where they will start their attack run.
. Flyers have an unlimited move, but you can only move them in the direction that they face when you place them.
So, you must move all Flyer units that are in the same detachment in parallel courses, in formation.
Enemy units can Snap Fire at them as they move -- but in contrast to ground units, Snap Fire does not halt the movement of Flyer units.
. You may halt movement of Flyer units at any point -- halt them all at the same time.
