= Anti-Personnel [weapon]

Weapon systems that are optimised to be especially effective against infantry and light vehicles.

---

When you shoot with an {anti-personnel} weapon:

. Roll a number of dice equal to the Firepower value of the unit.
Do not use the Firepower table for this attack.
. Discard any natural results of 6, and then discard misses as normal.
. The remaining dice are hits -- allocate them as you would for a regular Firepower attack.
