= Support

`Data sheet modifier`

These units are specially adapted from their original design, to specialise in close support of other units.

[NOTE.e40k]
====
We derived this ability from {e40k}'s experimental _Siege_ ability.
That ability is redundant on any unit that has a Firepower value of only `1`.
This ability allows more flexibility in unit design, in a minimalist way.

Where your unit has the {support} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Change its Range value to `15 cm`.
* Add the {close-support} ability.
* If its Firepower value is less than `2`, increase the value to `2`.
