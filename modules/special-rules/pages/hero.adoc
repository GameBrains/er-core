= Hero

`Data sheet modifier`

These units contain exceptional individuals who excel at warcraft.
As befits their heroic status, they usually have the best equipment too.

Common examples include Infantry units like the Space Marine Captain and the Ork Warboss -- but the ability can also apply to a Vehicle unit to represent special upgrades and a particularly experienced crew.
