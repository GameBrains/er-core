= Psyker

{unit-ability}

Some beings have psychic powers â€” that is, they can tap into the alternate dimension of the Warp and direct a little of its fickle energy on the battlefield and elsewhere.
These beings are known as 'pyskers'.

Some psychic powers are very subtle, but those that manifest on the battlefield tend to be spectacularly violent: a sudden conflagration of all-consuming spectral fire, a powerful bolt of dark lightning, a blast of telepathy that can bypass armour and melt minds.
