= Cavalry

{data-sheet-modifier}
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
We've shifted the Armour bonus part of {e40k}'s _Cavalry_ ability to a separate ability that we call {armour-1}.

Despite the abundance and variety of technologies in the galaxy of the 41^st^ millennium, armies still find uses for cavalry -- and not only on the most barbaric worlds.

Of course, riders and their mounts vary enormously -- humans on horses, denizens of Chaos on daemonic steeds, orks on cyboars, and many more.

Cavalry forgo some of the advantages of infantry -- they find it difficult to take cover, to move through buildings or rubble, and so on.
But they make up for this with speed.

Where your unit has the {cavalry} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Make its first Speed value two times (2x) the *first* Speed value of the base unit.

* Make its second Speed value three times (3x) the *first* Speed value of the base unit.

* Change the unit type to Vehicle (`VEH`).

.{cavalry} data sheet modifiers
====
We derive the Imperial Guard Rough Rider unit from the Imperial Guard unit as a base, plus the {cavalry} and {armour-1} abilities.
The {cavalry} ability means that:

* Whilst the base unit has a Speed value of `10/20 cm`, that of the Rough Riders is `20/30 cm` -- that is, `(10 x 2)/(10 x 3) cm`.
* Whilst the base unit has a unit type of Infantry (`INF`), that of the Rough Riders is Vehicle (`VEH`).

(And for the sake of completeness in this example:) The {armour-1} ability means that:

* Whilst the base unit has an Armour value of `3+`, that of the Rough Riders is `4+`.
