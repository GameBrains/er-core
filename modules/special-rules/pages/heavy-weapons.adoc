= Heavy Weapons

{data-sheet-modifier}

These units specialise in shooting, with weapons that give them longer range and more firepower.

Of course, their advantages in shooting come at a cost to their effectiveness in close combat.
Common examples include Ork Shooty Boyz and Space Marine Devastators.
