= Jump Packs

{data-sheet-modifier} {unit-ability}

These units are equipped with jet-powered devices or other technology, wings, or even powerful long legs that allow them to make long jumps across the battlefield.
The resultant speed and mobility usually makes for good assault troops.

== Data sheet effects of {jump-packs}

=== Where a base unit already has the {jump-packs} ability

Where your unit is a base unit that already has the {jump-packs} ability:

* Simply use the Speed value stated in the unit's data sheet -- we've already integrated the effect of {jump-packs}.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
Some base units -- such as the Tau Crisis Battlesuit and the Eldar Revenant Scout Titan -- have the {jump-packs} ability as an integral part of their data sheet.
We've clarified how the ability interacts with the data sheet in these cases.
]

=== Where the {jump-packs} ability is additional

Where your unit is *not* a base unit, and has the {jump-packs} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Make its first Speed value two times (2x) the *first* Speed value of the base unit.
footnote:split-speed[
include::main-rules:partial$charge-moves-split-speed.adoc[]
]
* Make its second Speed value three times (3x) the *first* Speed value of the base unit.

.{jump-packs} data sheet modifiers
====
The Eldar Swooping Hawks unit is an Aspect Warriors base unit with added {jump-packs} ability.

* The base unit has a Speed value of `15/30 cm`, whilst the Swooping Hawks unit has `30/45 cm` instead -- that is, `(15 x 2)/(15 x 3) cm`.
====

== Game effects of {jump-packs}

Where your unit has the {jump-packs} ability:

* When you move the unit, you may ignore terrain -- though you must still take a Dangerous Terrain test for the unit whenever a move starts in dangerous terrain, and whenever a move ends in dangerous terrain.
You still may not place the unit on impassable terrain.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
In {e40k}, it isn't clear whether or not the {jump-packs} ability lets us ignore the standard rules when we start a move in dangerous terrain.
After discussion with other players, we've decided that the standard rules apply, and we've made this clear.
]
* When you make a charge move with the unit, you can move it over enemy units that are already in base contact with your other units.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
We created this rule as part of efforts to rationalise and improve the rules for Assault moves, after discussion with other players.
