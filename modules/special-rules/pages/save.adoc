= Save

These units can beat the odds and escape destruction -- perhaps through exceptional armour, protective fields, or extreme skills and toughness.

---

Where your unit has the {save} ability:

* Each time the unit suffers a hit, from any source, roll a die.
On a roll of 4+, ignore the hit -- it causes no damage.

NOTE: While some attacks ignore void shields and power fields, these do *not* ignore the {save} ability.

NOTE: For placement of Blast markers, saved hits still count as hits.
