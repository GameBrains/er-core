= No Retreat

{detachment-ability}
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
We derived this ability from part of {e40k}'s War Engine 'No retreat, no surrender' rules for War Engine units.
This allows for more flexibility in detachment design.

Some forces never retreat from combat, no matter how bad it gets.

Where your detachment has the {no-retreat} ability:

* After you lose a close combat or firefight with the detachment, do *not* make a Retreat move with it.
Units in your detachment that remain within 15 cm of enemy units are *not* destroyed.

{blank}[TODO: We should add something about what happens if a {no-retreat} unit starts a turn in base contact with the enemy, as at link:https://thehobby.zone/resources/e40k-compendium/Content/More/HouseRulesFrequentlyAskedQuestionsAndOtherNonsense/FAQ_StartingTheTurnInContactWithTheEnemy.htm[FAQ: Starting the turn in contact with the enemy]]
