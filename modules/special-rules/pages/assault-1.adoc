= Assault +1

{data-sheet-modifier}
footnote:[
{e40k-diff}This ability is equivalent to {e40k}'s _Space Wolves_ ability.
We call it {assault-1} instead, so as not to imply that the ability is faction-specific.

These units are exceptionally fierce or gifted at close combat; yet they are no less capable or less equipped for ranged combat than others of their kind.

Where your unit has the {assault-1} ability, apply this change relative to its base unit:

* Add +1 to its Assault value.
