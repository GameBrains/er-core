= Rampage

{unit-ability}

Some units are so ferocious in close combat that they will rampage through enemy forces in a berserk fury, heedless of their own safety.

---

Where your unit has the {rampage} ability:

* When you roll for hits in close combat, roll two dice to score hits with this unit rather than the usual one die.
* While the unit is in base contact with an enemy unit, it cannot make a Retreat move.
This means that if you lose a close combat while you have {rampage} units in base contact with the enemy, these units are always caught and destroyed by the enemy.
Make the Retreat move with other units in the detachment as normal.
