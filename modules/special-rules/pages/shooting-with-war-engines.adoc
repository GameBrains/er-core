== War engine weapon mounts

[NOTE.e40k]
====
_Epic 40,000_ mentioned 'weapon mounts' but did not use the term consistently. This section combines multiple rules references and FAQs into a single rule.

+[TODO: Eric, could you rewrite this note?]
====

All war engines have a number of weapon mounts, listed in separate lines on their data sheets.

.War engine data sheets
====
* A Warlord Titan has four weapon mounts, its left arm, right arm, left carapace, and right carapace.
* A Baneblade has one weapon mount, its turret guns.
* A Shadowsword has two weapon mounts, its {death-ray} and its sponson turrets.
====

Each weapon mount:

* cannot split fire between target detachments
* is a single weapon for critical damage results that destroy a weapon or limit the war engine to firing one weapon

In addition, a weapon mount that does not have a plain Firepower value counts as a single super-heavy weapon, so:

* is suppressed by 1 Blast marker
* is one weapon for placing Blast markers
* rolls once to lock on if Firepower is halved
* contributes 1 Firepower in a firefight


.Firepower weapon mounts: Warhound Titan
====
A Warhound Titan has two weapon mounts.
Each of its weapon mounts carries a heavy weapon battery with Firepower 6.

* Both weapon mounts can shoot at the same detachment for a total of 12 Firepower.
* Each weapon mount can shoot at a different detachment, directing 6 Firepower at each.
* Each weapon mount can only shoot at one detachment, so you cannot fire at more than two detachments at once.
* Each Blast marker on the Warhound reduces its total Firepower by one.
* If the Warhound's Firepower is halved, you do not need to lock on with each battery, but instead you halve its total Firepower.
====

.Mixed weapon mounts: Shadowsword
====
A Shadowsword has two weapon mounts.
The {death-ray} has Range 60 cm.
The sponson turrets mount has Range 30 cm and Firepower 2.

* Both weapon mounts can shoot at the same detachment for a total of 2 Firepower and a {death-ray} shot.
* Each weapon mount can shoot at a different detachment, directing 2 Firepower at one, and a {death-ray} shot at the other.
* Each weapon mount can only shoot at one detachment, so you cannot fire at more than two detachments at once.
* Each Blast marker on the Shadowsword reduces its total Firepower by one, and any remaining Blast markers will suppress the {death-ray}.
** If both the weapon mounts are in range, 3 Blast markers will completely suppress the Shadowsword's shooting.
** If there are no targets within the 30 cm Range of the sponson turrets weapon mount, the Shadowsword has 0 Firepower so a single Blast marker will completely suppress the Shadowsword's shooting.
* If the Shadowsword's Firepower is halved, roll to lock on with the {death-ray}, and halve the Firepower of the sponson turrets.

== War engine fire arcs

Each weapon mount on a war engine has a fire arc, and can only be used against targets within that fire arc. The fire arc is shown with an icon on the data sheet.

The arrow in the centre of each icon shows the facing of the war engine.
The black segment shows the fire arc of the mount.

====
_Epic 40,000_ only had four different fire arcs, we have added more options.
