This weapon is unique to the Eldar race, and it demonstrates their mastery of laser weaponry.

As a result, the weapon can destroy multiple targets in a single salvo.

When you make a {pulsar-x} shot:

IMPORTANT: A {pulsar-x} shot results in a salvo of {macro-weapon} shots -- but it still only counts as a single super-heavy weapon.

. Determine the number of shots in the salvo, based on the value of `(X)` that we specify — for example, _`(D3+1)`_ or _`(D6)`_.
. Resolve that many {macro-weapon} shots against the target detachment.

IMPORTANT: Remember, {pulsar-x} represents a single super-heavy weapon -- the resultant salvo of {macro-weapon} shots does *not* count as multiple super-heavy weapons for placement of Blast markers, suppression, contribution to firefights, or any other game purpose.
