= Jungle Fighters

`Unit ability`
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
This ability is equivalent to {e40k}'s _Kroot_ ability.
We call it {jungle-fighters} instead, so as not to imply that the ability is faction-specific.

Some infantry are especially well adapted to jungle fighting.

Where your unit has the {jungle-fighters} ability:

* Treat woods and jungle terrain as fortifications for this unit.
That is, when the unit is in cover in woods or jungle terrain, apply a +2 Infantry Armour bonus for cover rather than the usual +1.
