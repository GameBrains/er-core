= War engines in firefights

War engines participate in firefights in much the same way as other units.

* Count the Firepower of each weapon system that can draw a line of fire to at least one enemy unit within 15 cm.
* Count 1 Firepower for each ranged super-heavy weapon system that can draw a line of fire to at least one enemy unit within 15 cm, regardless of the number of shots it has.
