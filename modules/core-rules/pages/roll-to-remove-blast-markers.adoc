= R1. Remove Blast markers

Detachments can overcome or work around some of the negative effects that we represent with Blast markers -- and so you may be able to remove some or all Blast markers from your detachments.

For each of your detachments that has any Blast markers on it, roll and remove D6-1 Blast markers.
(So, the actual number of Blast markers that you remove will vary from one detachment to the next, but will be between 0 and 5.)
