Where you have units that have the {recovery} ability in play, do not remove Vehicle units that are destroyed by dangerous terrain.
Instead, identify these units with a marker or place them on their side. 

You may use a unit that has the {recovery} ability to recover the marked units:

. Move the {recovery} unit into base contact with a marked unit.
. In the Rally phase, roll a D6:
* 1 to 3: Recovery is not possible.
Remove the marked unit from play.
* 4 to 6: Success! Place the marked vehicle upright.
It is no longer destroyed and you may use it as normal from next turn onwards.
