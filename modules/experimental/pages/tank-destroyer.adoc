We've replaced this ability with the more flexible {has-macro-weapon} ability.

These units are specially adapted from their original design, to replace their main armament with a more potent anti-armour capability.

Where your unit has the {tank-destroyer} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Replace its Firepower value with a single {macro-weapon} super-heavy weapon.
