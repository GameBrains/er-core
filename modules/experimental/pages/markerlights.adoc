Where your unit has the {markerlights} ability:

* As long as the unit's detachment is not Broken and was not placed on March orders this turn, then:
** Each enemy detachment that is currently within 30 cm and line of fire of the unit is 'marked'.
(This is relevant for interaction with certain other abilities.)
