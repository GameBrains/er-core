= Shootier

{data-sheet-modifier}

These units are specially adapted from their original design, with extra weapons to which increase their firepower.
However, this comes at the cost of more weight and so less speed.

---

Where your unit has the {shootier} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Increase its Firepower value by 1.
** Or, if the unit also has either the {macro-weapon} or {anti-personnel} super-heavy weapon then give it one extra shot instead.
// TODO: Do we need to reword or clarify this? The term 'shot' in the context of a super-heavy weapon was fine in the original rules, but in this project this term has a more restricted meaning per the war engine rules for weapons systems. The specific interpretation affects how split fire should work on regular units that have multiple super-heavy weapons versus multiple super-heavy weapon *shots.
** Or, if the unit also has the {barrage} super-heavy weapon, treat this as {heavy-barrage} instead.
* Reduce its Speed value by 5 cm.
