The troopers in this detachment are filled with bloodlust and the joy of battle.

---

Where your detachment has the {frenzy} ability:

* During the Assault phase *only*: The detachment has the {stubborn} ability, so you may re-roll Leadership tests that you fail for this detachment.
* In close combats, the detachment gets a +1 bonus to the assault resolution roll.
This bonus does *not* stack with the bonus from other detachments that also have the {frenzy} ability, nor with the bonus for having more {psyker} units.
