= Long Range

`Data sheet modifier`

These units are specially adapted from their original design, to improve the range of their main armament.
However, this comes at the cost of more weight and so less speed.

---

Where your unit has the {long-range} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Increase its Range value by 15 cm.
* Reduce its Speed value by 5 cm.
