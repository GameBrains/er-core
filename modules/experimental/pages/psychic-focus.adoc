Some detachments contain many individuals that have low-level psychic power that they can pool as a group.
When they do this, they can manifest some useful effects on the battlefield.

---

Where your detachment has the {psychic-focus} ability:

* Once per game, you can make a special psychic attack with this detachment.
This works exactly as if it were a Fate card with the title 'Psychic Attack (0) â€” Psychic Blast'.
* When you wish to make the above attack, or to play a Psychic Attack Fate card, you may choose any unit in this detachment to channel the effects, as if that unit had the {psyker} ability.
