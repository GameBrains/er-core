`Unit ability`

{blank}[TODO: Add introductory text.]

---

Where your {transport-x} unit has the {open-top} ability:

* While the unit carries embarked units, you may shoot or fight close combat with some of them -- no more than half of the {transport-x} capacity (round up).
* If the unit suffers a hit from a {barrage} or {heavy-barrage} weapon then each embarked unit also suffers a hit.
