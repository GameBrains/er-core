We've replaced this ability with the more flexible {support} ability.
]

These units are specially adapted from their original design, to specialise in close support of other units.
They have particular value in operations that involve assaults on fortifications or in the close confines of cities.

---

Where your unit has the {siege} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Change its Range value to `15 cm`.
* Add the {close-support} special ability.
