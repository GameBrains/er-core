= How to use this publication

== Notes, examples and asides

[NOTE]

Further explanation, where it may help you to understand concepts or relationships between rules.

[NOTE.option]
====
Notes to highlight an alternative or additional way to play that some players prefer to the default.
If you want to use an option, you and your opponent must both agree.
====

TIP: Advice to help you learn the rules more effectively or get the best out of the game.

== Footnotes
Footnotes, for additional information.
footnote:[
We use footnotes like this to present additional information.
In particular, we often use footnotes to highlight ways in which {project-name} differs from {e40k}.

== Body text styles

`Monospace font with grey background`: We use this mainly to reference characteristic values that we either state on a 'data sheet' or that we bring into effect through a dynamic rule.
For example: Speed `10 cm`; Armour `5+`.

_Italic_ font style: We use this to emphasise a specific 'special ability' or the title of a publication.
