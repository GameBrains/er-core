=== Drop Pods tokens

xref:attachment$er-drop-pods-tokens_v1.0.pdf[ER Drop Pods tokens, window=\_blank] (PDF)
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
The {e40k} product line didn't include any Drop Pods tokens, only a suggestion to "make some Drop Pod markers by tearing or cutting up a load of paper squares (about 1 cm across) and writing a number or letter on each one".
However, the Drop Pods rules are similar to those in the preceding edition of Epic, for which 15 mm square cardboard Drop Pods tokens were available in an expansion set.
Our download approximates those tokens.
