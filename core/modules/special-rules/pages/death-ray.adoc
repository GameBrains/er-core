= Death Ray

These weapons focus colossal amounts of energy at a point, to destroy a single target even at great distance.

The technology and form varies; but almost every major warring race in the 41^st^ millennium uses {death-ray} weapons of some sort.

---

When you make a {death-ray} shot:

. Pick any target within range and line of fire, even a specific unit in a detachment.
. Roll a D6.
If you roll a 2+ then the target suffers a hit, regardless of armour or cover.
* A {death-ray} hit on a War Engine unit always causes critical damage.
Roll for a result on the unit's Critical Damage table.
