= Super Lifta-Droppa

This unusual but powerful weapon is unique to the Orks.
Human tech-priests are at a loss to explain how it works, except to note its effects.

Ork Mekboys use the weapon to focus a traktor beam on the target and then lift the target high above the ground -- or above juicy secondary targets nearby.
Then they drop the first target onto the secondary targets...

When you make a {super-lifta-droppa} shot:

. Pick any Vehicle or War Engine target within range and line of sight, even a specific unit in a detachment.
You cannot target Infantry units.
. Roll a D6.
If you roll a result that is higher than the initial Damage Capacity value of the target unit, then the weapon hits.
+
Vehicle units usually have a Damage Capacity value of 1.
War Engine units vary, so check the target unit's data sheet.
. If the target unit has the {save} ability or the {holo-fields} ability, then your opponent may attempt the save.
If they are successful then the target is unharmed and nothing further happens -- do not continue below.
. For each point by which your result is higher than the target unit's initial Damage Capacity value, you can move the unit up to 1 cm in any direction, above other game pieces.
This is where the {super-lifta-droppa} will drop the target unit.
. Resolve the drop:
* The target unit is automatically destroyed.
If it is a War Engine unit, roll for a result on its Catastrophic Damage table.
* For each unit that is under the target unit, roll a D6.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
We consider a unit to be 'under' where any part of the unit's base is under or touched by the outline of the target unit -- no matter the unit type.
]
On a roll of 4+, that unit suffers a hit.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
We state this so that we can explain certain rules interactions more clearly.
Whilst {e40k} does not define success with the _Super Lifta Droppa_ effect as a 'hit', in _Firepower_ magazine issue 2 Games Workshop did confirm that the _Holo-fields_ 'save' can protect against this weapon -- see link:https://thehobby.zone/resources/e40k-compendium/Content/More/QuestionsAndAnswers/QA_SuperLiftaDroppa.htm[Q&A: Super Lifta Droppa^].
And, as the {save} ability works in a similar way to {holo-fields}, we  use the 'hit' terminology to be consistent and to imply that both of these abilities have the potential to protect the unit.
