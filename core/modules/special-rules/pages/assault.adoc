= Assault

{data-sheet-modifier}

These units specialise in close combat, through a combination of skills, doctrine and equipment.

Of course, their advantages in close combat come at a cost to their long-range firepower.

Where your unit has the {assault} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Add +1 to its Assault value.
* Change its Range value to `15 cm`.

Where your unit has both the {assault} ability *and* the {heavy-weapons} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Halve its Assault value, then add +1 to that total to get the new value (round up).
* Change its Range value to `45 cm`.
