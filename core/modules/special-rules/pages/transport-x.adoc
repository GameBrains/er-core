= Transport (X)

{unit-ability}

These units have the interior spaces and other features that make them ideal to transport certain other units across the battlefield.

---

Where your unit has the {transport-x} ability:

* It can transport Infantry units as cargo -- or in some cases, specific units that we state in the army lists or elsewhere.
It can carry as many of these units as we state in brackets.
+
See the main transportation rules for more about how this works.

NOTE: A {transport-x} unit does not gain the abilities of embarked units.
