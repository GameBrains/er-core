= Rapid Fire

{unit-ability}

These units are especially skilled at laying down heavy, accurate fire when they are in a static position.

---

Where your unit has the {rapid-fire} ability:

* While it is on Overwatch orders, add +1 to its Firepower value.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
In {e40k}, when the _Rapid Fire_ ability is active it *doubles* the unit's Firepower value.
We've changed this so that the effect scales in linear fashion when we add {rapid-fire} to units that have Firepower `2` or more.
This doesn't affect any of the original {e40k} units that have _Rapid Fire_ -- they all have Firepower `1`, so the net result remains the same.

NOTE: Units that have the {heavy-weapons} ability cannot use the {rapid-fire} ability.
