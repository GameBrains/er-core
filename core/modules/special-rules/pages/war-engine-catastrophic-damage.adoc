= War engine catastrophic damage

A destroyed war engine might be only wrecked.
Or, it might be annihilated in a spectacular fashion that presents a hazard to nearby units, whether friend or foe.

When a War Engine unit's current Damage Capacity value reaches `0`, it suffers *catastrophic damage*.
Roll a D6 and check the result against the Catastrophic Damage Table on that unit's data sheet.
