= Flyers

'Flyers' are aircraft and -- in the case of Tyranids -- giant creatures that act like aircraft.
Nimble fighter aircraft, sturdy fighter-bombers, lumbering bombers, cargo transport aircraft -- all have their place in support of ground forces in the 41^st^ millennium.

In many ways, Flyer units and detachments are quite different to ground forces, and their rules reflect this.

== Flyer data sheets

Flyers have data sheets just like regular units -- but with these differences:

* The Speed value is always `Flyer`.
Flyer units are so fast that we treat them as though their Speed value is unlimited -- you can move them as far as you wish across the play area.
* The Assault value is a split value, such as `2/2`.
We call this the 'Dogfight value' -- although most of the time we refer specifically to only one of its two parts:
** The first number is the *Intercept value* of the flyer, which represents its overall manoeuvrability.
** The second number is its *Gunnery value*, which represents the overall deadliness of the flyer's air-to-air weaponry, when it can get an enemy flyer in its sights.

== Deployment of flyers

You don't deploy flyers along with other units at the start of the battle -- place them somewhere outside of the playing area, in the Ready state (see xref:flyer-readiness-states.adoc[]).
You can imagine that they are in orbit, or stationed at a nearby airbase.

== Flyers and Blast markers

Do not place Blast markers on Flyer detachments, at all.

== Flyers and assaults

Flyers can never take part in close combats or firefights in any way, and can never become Broken.

{blank}[TODO: This sounds absolute, but there is the edge case of landed transport aircraft. Consider new wording -- or perhaps a simple footnote to acknowledge this exception would suffice. Although I suppose we might also need to clarify some points of detail about this edge case somewhere in this section.]
