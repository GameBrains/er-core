= Types of special ability

About the different types of ability and how we use them in the game.

== Data sheet modifier

These abilities do not provide special rules effects.
Rather, they modify the characteristic values on unit data sheets.

.Data sheet modifiers
====
The {heavy-weapons} ability changes the unit's Range and Firepower characteristic values.
====

[[data-sheet-modifiers]]
.Application of data sheet modifiers
====
The Imperial Guard Rough Riders unit is based on the Imperial Guard unit, with the addition of the {cavalry}, {assault} and {armour-1} abilities.

These abilities create several differences between the unit data sheets, as you can see below.

== Unit ability

These abilities provide special effects that you may use with the units that they apply to.

.Unit abilities
====
With {save}, you may be able to 'save' the unit from a hit so that you don't have to remove it as a casualty.

With {jump-packs}, you get the benefit of enhanced movement effects.
====

== Detachment ability

These abilities change the behaviour of an entire detachment.

.Detachment abilities
====
{hit-and-run} allows you to make a Retreat move with the detachment, even after you win a close combat or firefight with it.
====

== Army ability

These abilities affect the way that you play with an entire army.

.Army abilities
====
When you field an Ork army, the {ork-initiative} rule lets you place Initiative counters back into the mug at the start of the Assault phase.
