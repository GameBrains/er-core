= Dodge

{detachment-ability}
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
This ability is equivalent to {e40k}'s _Ravenwing_ ability.
We call it {dodge} instead, so as not to imply that the ability is faction-specific.

Some formations of very mobile troops can dodge and jink so effectively that they are hard to target.

Where your detachment has the {dodge} ability, you can use special orders called Dodge:

. If you wish to place any detachments on Dodge orders then you must do this in the Start phase.
footnote:[

]
. Place a {special-om} to indicate that the detachment is on Dodge orders.
While Dodge orders are in effect:
 ** Increase the Armour value of all units in the detachment by one, to a maximum of 6+.
 ** Halve the total Firepower of the detachment.
