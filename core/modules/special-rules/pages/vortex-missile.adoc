= Vortex Missile

This weapon is among the most destructive one-shot missile systems ever created.

When the warhead detonates it creates a ravening vortex of energy which actually creates a giant rift between the warp and reality.
This is like the effect of the {distortion-cannon}, but greater and thus particularly effective against war engines.

The vortex consumes anything it contacts in the brief moments before it collapses and the rift vanishes.

When you make a {vortex-missile} shot:

. Place a Barrage template in the standard way.
. For each unit that is covered by the template, roll a D6 and resolve this many {death-ray} shots against it.

NOTE: Vortex missiles are extremely powerful, so we limit their use to significant War Engine units.
