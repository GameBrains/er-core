= Unbreakable

{detachment-ability}
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
We derived this ability from parts of {e40k}'s Tyranid army 'Synapse Creatures' rules and War Engine 'No retreat, no surrender' rules.
This allows for more flexibility in detachment design.

Some troops have such high morale, or lack of individual willpower, that they never break.

Where your detachment has the {unbreakable} ability:

* The detachment can never become Broken.

NOTE: If you lose a close combat or firefight with the detachment then you must still make a Retreat move with it -- unless it also has the {no-retreat} ability.
