= Flyer readiness states

Flyer units can only take part in a mission when they are properly prepared, and they must rearm and refuel after each mission.
They may also need repairs if they are driven off -- that is, if they are hit but not destroyed while on a mission.

---

Keep track of your flyers' state of readiness, as follows:

* *Repair*: Place Flyer units in this state when they are hit but not destroyed (see xref:hits-on-flyers.adoc[]).
You must leave them here for one full turn -- then, at the end of that turn, move them to the Rearm state.
* *Rearm*: Place Flyer units in this state after they have performed a mission, or they missed a turn in the Repair state.
You must leave them here for one full turn -- then, at the end of that turn, move them to the Ready state.
* *Ready*: Place Flyer units here at the start of the game, and after they leave the Rearm state.
In the Start phase, you may declare a flyer mission for any detachment that has at least one Flyer unit in the Ready state.

TIP: The original {e40k} cardboard airfields provide a visually appealing way to keep track.
Of course you could make your own equivalent, which could be a nice hobby project, or you can just use another method such as pen and paper.
