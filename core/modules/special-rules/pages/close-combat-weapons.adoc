= Close Combat Weapons

War engines make excellent gun platforms, but some of them trade some firepower for weapons that afford greater potency in close combat.

Such weapons include huge powered fists, saws and rams, ripping tentacles, fierce short-ranged cutting torches, and more besides.
Their primary purpose is to gain a big advantage over other war engines and mangle them in close combat.
