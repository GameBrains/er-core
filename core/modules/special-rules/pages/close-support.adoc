= Close Support

{unit-ability}

These units are equipped with weapons that are especially effective in support of close combat -- such as flamethrowers, heavy short-ranged cannons and bomb launchers.

---

Where your unit has the {close-support} ability:

* When it would lend support in a close combat, count its full Firepower value instead of only +1 to the Assault value total.
+
NOTE: To be clear, if a {close-support} unit is in base contact with an enemy unit then you must use its Assault value as normal.
