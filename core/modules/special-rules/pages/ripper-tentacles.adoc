= Ripper Tentacles

These are biological symbiote weapons, unique to Tyranid bio-titans.
They seem to have a mind of their own, as they writhe and strike under the control of nerve bundles that are separate from the bio-titan's main cortex.

The hulking ropes of muscle and sinew are immensely powerful, able to trap the combat machinery of opposing war engines.

Where your War Engine unit is armed with {ripper-tentacles}:

* When it fights against one or more enemy War Engine units in close combat, choose one {close-combat-weapons} system.
The {ripper-tentacles} wrap around and trap that system, which means that the enemy gains no benefit from it for this close combat.
