= Weapon mount examples

These examples explain weapon mounts, systems and arcs in more detail.

The detail will be easiest to understand if you also refer to the appropriate war engine data sheets.
{blank}[TODO: Add relevant cross-references/related info links when the new data sheets are in the project. Or perhaps use cropped images of the parts that are most relevant for each example.]

.Weapon mounts
====
The Imperial Baneblade super-heavy tank has one weapon mount (and so only one weapon arc):

* *Main Weapons* (`All Around`).
This mount holds a Firepower weapon system named Turret Guns.

The Imperial Warlord Titan is more complex.
It has four weapon mounts (with a total of three weapon arcs):

* *Left Arm* (`Left 180°`); *Right Arm* (`Right 180°`); *Left Carapace* and *Right Carapace* (both `Front 90°`).
+
For each mount, you can choose a weapon system from a variety of options, as we detail elsewhere.
====

.Multiple Firepower weapon systems -- the Warhound Titan
====
The Imperial Warhound Titan has two weapon mounts:

* *Left Arm* and *Right Arm* (both `Front 90°`).
In this case, each mount holds a weapon system named Weapon Battery (Firepower `6`).

.Split fire
You may shoot both weapon systems at the same target detachment, to direct a total of 12 Firepower at it.
Or, you may split fire to shoot each Weapon Battery at a different target detachment, to direct 6 Firepower at each of them.

.Suppression
For each Blast marker on the Warhound Titan, choose a Weapon Battery and reduce its Firepower by one.

.Half Firepower (no lock-on)
If you are forced to halve the Firepower of the Warhound Titan, then do this as normal -- as each Weapon Battery is a Firepower weapon system you do not need to test to lock on like you must with a super-heavy weapon system.
====

.Mixed weapon systems -- the Shadowsword
====
The Imperial Shadowsword super-heavy tank has two weapon mounts:

* *Main Weapons* (`Front 90°`).
This mount holds a ranged super-heavy weapon system named Volcano Cannon (`{death-ray}`, Range `60 cm`).
* *Secondary Weapons* (`All Around`).
This mount holds a Firepower weapon system named Sponson Turrets (Firepower `2`, Range `30 cm`).

.Split fire
You may shoot both weapon systems at the same target detachment for a total of one {death-ray} shot and 2 Firepower.
Or, you may shoot the weapon systems at two different target detachments, to direct the {death-ray} shot at one and 2 Firepower at another.

.Suppression
Where your target is within range and line of fire of both weapon systems, then it will take three Blast markers to completely suppress the Shadowsword's shooting -- two to bring the Sponson Turrets down to zero Firepower and one to suppress the Volcano Cannon.

Where your target is not within the range and line of fire of the Sponson Turrets, then it will take only one Blast marker to completely suppress the Shadowsword's shooting.
This is because it has no Firepower available and so a single Blast marker is enough to suppress the Volcano Cannon.

.Half Firepower and lock-on
If you are forced to halve the Firepower of the Shadowsword, then do this as normal -- and also roll to lock on with the Volcano Cannon.
