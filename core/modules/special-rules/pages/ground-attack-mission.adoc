=== Complete the attack

. Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase -- use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have.
But note:
* You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range *and* inside the forward 90Â° arc of your Flyer unit.
Ignore any intervening terrain though, as it is far below the altitude of the flyers.
* Otherwise, the attack works just like a normal shooting attack -- so for example,as long as you meet the other requirements then you may split fire between multiple target detachments.
. After you resolve the shooting effects, the attack is complete and the flyers disengage.
They go to full power and rapidly climb out of reach of ground-based weapons.
Remove them from the play area and place them in the Rearm state.
