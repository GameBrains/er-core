= CC2. Work out close combat bonuses
:bonus-cc:

Each player receives bonuses in the close combat that are dependent on how certain factors compare for each side.

Your Assault value total from the previous step is important, but you don't make direct use of it to resolve the close combat -- rather, you compare your totals and the player that has the higher total gets a bonus.
You'll combine this with other bonuses and use your overall bonus in the the assault resolution roll that you'll make in the next step.
