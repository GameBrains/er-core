= R3. Attempt repairs

This step is relevant only for war engines with minor (repairable) damage or collapsed void shields.

For each repairable critical damage effect and each collapsed void shield, take a Repair test.

Roll a D6: On a score of 4 or more you succeed -- the critical damage effect or void shield is repaired.
