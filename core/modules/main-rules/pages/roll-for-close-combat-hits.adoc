= CC5. Roll for close combat hits

In close combat Armour values are ignored and instead you get a hit if you equal or beat the hit number shown on the Close combat results table.
Look up the combat difference on the table to find out the hit numbers for winning and losing units.

Roll a D6 for each of your units in base-to-base contact with the enemy, even if you lost.
Don't forget that you can place a maximum of two units in base contact with an enemy unit.
You can choose which enemy units to apply hits against -- but, similar to the allocation of shooting hits, you may not allocate a second hit to a unit unless you have already allocated a hit to every unit that is in base contact.

In this combat, the Space Marines have scored 8 while the Orks have only managed to score 5 -- a difference of 3 points.
As well as placing 3 Blast markers on the Orks, the result is looked up on the Close combat results table.
This shows that the Space Marine player needs to roll 3+ to kill the Orks, who in turn need scores of 5+ to eliminate the Space Marines.

The Space Marine player has 6 units in contact and so rolls 6 dice, scoring 3, 3, 5, 5, 5 & 6 -- an astounding roll that wipes out the 4 Ork units in contact (the excess hits are wasted).
The Ork player rolls 4 dice and scores 2, 3, 5 & 6 which inflicts 2 hits.
He assigns these to the Space Marines on his flank, hoping to increase the surviving Orks' chances of withdrawing safely.
