= R2. Attempt to rally Broken detachments

If you can rally a Broken detachment then you will regain control so that you can issue orders to it again next turn.

For each Broken detachment that you have, take a Rally test to see if they rally.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You may only attempt a Rally test when a Broken detachment has fewer Blast markers than the number of units it has remaining.

.Rally test
Make a standard Leadership test -- all the usual rules for modifiers and such apply.

* If you succeed then the detachment rallies -- remove the {broken-cm} from the detachment;
* If you fail then the detachment remains Broken -- try again in the next Rally phase. 

Either way, leave the Blast markers in place.
