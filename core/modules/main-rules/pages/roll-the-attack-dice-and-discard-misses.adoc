= S5. Roll the attack dice and discard misses

Take a moment to savour the tension and to make an evil grin while you tell your opponent that all his alien scum or whatever are going to die... and then:

. Roll the attack dice.
. Discard any attack dice which scored less than the target detachment's lowest Armour value.
. The remaining dice are hits.
We refer to these as 'hit dice'.
The score of each hit die is important for the next step in the shooting procedure.
