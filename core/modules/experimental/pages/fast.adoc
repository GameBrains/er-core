= Fast

{data-sheet-modifier}

This ability applies to some Vehicle unit variants.
// TODO: Should we use text like this on some or all of the abilities which originate from 'Vehicle variant rules', to make clear where they only apply to vehicles?
It represents vehicles which have been stripped of weapons or armour to increase their speed.

---

Where your unit has the {fast} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Increase its Speed value by 5 cm.
* Reduce its Firepower value by 1 -- or if this would result in a Firepower value of `0`, then reduce their Armour value by 1 instead.
