= Evac mission

Not only can you use transport flyers to deploy troops -- as in an Air Transport mission -- you can also use them to evacuate troops to safety.
You might do this simply to save units from imminent destruction, or to redeploy them to greater effect elsewhere on the battlefield in a later turn.

****
This is our version of the _Evac! Evac!_ mission that appeared in the _Air Superiority_ article which Games Workshop published in both _Firepower_, issue 1, and _White Dwarf_, issue 214.

The article offered the mission as 'optional' rules that you must agree with your opponent -- neither fully 'official', nor 'experimental'.
{blank}[TODO: This seems like a bit of an oddity. Consider whether to make this mission fully part of the _Remastered_ rules, or to pursue another alternative.]

== Requirements for the mission

* You can only evacuate units where they are valid cargo for the particular {transport-x} Flyer units that you use.
* {blank}[TODO: Add points on what happens when you have non-valid/excess units that you must leave behind. Perhaps comment on HQ units and command too.]

== Declare the mission

== Perform the mission

=== Deploy, and make the attack run

include::special-rules:partial$deploy-and-make-the-attack-run.adoc[]

=== Complete the attack

. Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase -- use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have.
But note:
* You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range *and* inside the forward 90Â° arc of your Flyer unit.
Ignore any intervening terrain though, as it is far below the altitude of the flyers.
* Otherwise, the attack works just like a normal shooting attack -- so for example,as long as you meet the other requirements then you may split fire between multiple target detachments.
* *Halve the Firepower* of each {transport-x} Flyer unit that will disembark cargo units (and roll to lock on with any super-heavy weapons).
. After you resolve the shooting effects, leave the {transport-x} Flyer units where they are until the end of the Movement phase.

=== Embark the cargo units

. With the units in the detachment that you intend to embark, make a 20 cm Retreat move, just as if they were Broken.
This means that you can move them without a Leadership test, no matter how many Blast markers are on the detachment.
+
{blank}[TODO: Presumably they would also be destroyed if we end their move within 15 cm of enemy units, as normal -- but as long as they reach and embark in the transport flyers they are okay? A 'hot' extraction!]
+
Embark the cargo units just like you would with a ground transportation unit.
But note:
+
* In each case, measure to the *centre* of the transport flyer's flight stand.
+
{blank}[TODO: Make sure that this mirrors the Air Transport case, whatever we decide about possible edge cases.]
+
{blank}[TODO: When *exactly* should we complete the Retreat move to embark the cargo units? Immediately I presume, but might there be any reason to allow players to do it later in the phase if they prefer in some cases?]
+
[NOTE]
====
While your {transport-x} Flyer units are landed, they are subject to the same game effects as ground units.
This means that, for example:

* Your opponent may use artillery on Preparatory Bombardment orders to shoot at them in the Movement phase, before they can disengage.
* There is no chance that a flyer on the ground will be 'driven off' -- a hit will always cause damage, just as it does with non-Flyer units.
====
+
. At the end of the Movement phase, the transport flyers take off with their cargo and disengage -- remove them from the playing area {blank}[TODO: ..."and place them in the Rearm state"?].
* If you're forced to leave any of the cargo detachment units behind, then leave all Blast markers it has in place.
* If you leave no units behind, remove all Blast markers from the detachment with no penalty.
+
From the next turn onwards, treat the evacuated detachment as though it is a Flyer detachment in reserve (see xref:battles:scenario-special-rules:reserves.adoc[]).
When you get a successful roll to check it's 'arrival', it is ready to return to combat -- you can use an Air Transport mission to return them to the battlefield, if and when you have {transport-x} Flyer units available in the Ready state.
+
{blank}[TODO: This seems needlessly complex and limiting, especially given that in the average game it is already pretty difficult to get a Flyer detachment to appear in a battle more than once. Consider some adjustments.]
