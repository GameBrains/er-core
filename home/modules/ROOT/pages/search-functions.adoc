= Search functions

The search feature uses software called *Lunr*.
Lunr supports some special search functions that you can use to refine your search.
We explain some of these here.

== Stemming function

By default, Lunr includes variations on stem words in its results.

.Stem words and their variations
====
`shoot` will yield not only instances of the stem word 'shoot' but also variations such as 'shoots', 'shooter' and 'shooting'.
====

This works in combination with most other search functions.

== Exact match function

Many search tools support exact match searches, usually through the use of double quotation marks (`"ork"`).
However, at the time of writing, Lunr does not support exact match search.

== Wildcard function

You can use an asterisk (`*`) as a wildcard, anywhere in your search term.

.Trailing wildcard search
====
`sho*` will yield instances of words that begin with 'sho', such as 'shoot' and 'should'.
====

.Leading wildcard search
====
`*oot` will yield instances of words that end with 'oot', such as 'shoot' and 'boot'.
====

NOTE: According to the Lunr documentation leading wildcards "â€¦should be used sparingly. They can have a negative impact on the performance of a search, especially in large indexes."

.Middle wildcard search
====
`s*t` will yield instances of words that begin with 's' and end with 't', such as 'shoot' and 'silent'.
====

== Titles-only function

By default, Lunr will search both the content of topics and the titles of topics.
If you want to find matches only in titles, you can use the `title:` prefix.

.Titles-only search
====
`title:shoot` will yield only instances of 'shoot' that appear in topic titles -- it will not yield instances that appear elsewhere in the content.
====

You can combine titles-only search with other search functions and multiple terms.

.Titles-only search with other functions and terms
====
`title:sho* fire` will yield instances where a word in a topic title begins with 'sho', or where the word 'fire' appears anywhere in the content.
====

== Term presence function

You can of course enter multiple terms into the search box at one time.
By default, Lunr will combine your terms together with the logical operator `OR` -- and thus you'll get results that match any or all of the terms you entered.

.Term presence search -- default behaviour with multiple terms
====
`ork gun` will yield instances where either 'ork' *or* 'gun' exist, *or both* exist.
(Effectively 'ork `OR` gun'.)
====

However, you can change the behaviour for each term that you enter.
You can define which terms you want to be present or absent to match results:

* To indicate that a term must be *present*, prefix the term with a plus (`+`) character.
* To indicate that a term must be *absent*, prefix the term with a minus (`-`) character.

.Term presence search -- 'must', 'may' and 'must not' behaviour
====
`+ork gun -trukk` will yield instances that must contain 'ork', may contain 'gun' and must not contain 'trukk'.
(Effectively 'ork `AND/OR` gun `NOT` trukk'.)
====

.Term presence search -- 'must' behaviour to simulate `AND`
====
`+ork +gun` will simulate a logical operator `AND` search -- that is, it will yield only results that contain both 'ork' and 'gun'.
(Effectively 'ork `AND` gun'.)
====

== Fuzzy-match function

Fuzzy matching can be helpful where you're not sure how to spell a word, or you want to expand your search to include more 'close' matches in your search results.

To use this, append a tilde (`~`) and then a positive integer to a term.
The positive integer defines the 'edit distance'.

An edit distance of `1` will match words that differ from your search term by only one character.
That is, words that would match your search term if you were to add, remove or change a single character, or to transpose a single pair of characters.

.Fuzzy-match search
====
`ork~1` will yield instances of words that are within one edit of 'ork' -- such as 'Mork' or 'ark'.
This search would not return matches for 'stork' as that would require two edits, to add an 's' and a 't'.
====

== Boost function

When you search for multiple terms, it may be that some terms are more important to you than others -- that is, results where these terms have a more significant presence are likely to be more relevant to you.

For such cases, you can 'boost' the relevance of particular terms.
This makes Lunr treat those terms with more significance -- any topic that matches a boosted term will get a higher relevance score, and appear higher up in the search results.

To apply a boost to a term, append a caret (`^`) and then a positive integer.

.Boosted search -- single boosted term
====
`shoot broken^10` will score the term 'broken' 10 times higher than the term 'shoot'.
So, Lunr will prioritise results that include the word 'broken' ahead of those that contain the word 'shoot'.
====

The boost value can be any positive integer, and you can give different boosts to different terms if you like:

.Boosted search -- multiple boosted terms
====
`shoot broken^10 retreat^5 orders`
====
